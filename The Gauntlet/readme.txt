Gameplay:

Select a Class
There are four player classes; Paladin, Knight, Fighter, and Rogue
Paladin stats - health 1200, attack 250
Knight stats - health 1000, attack 100
Fighter - health 800, attack 200
Rogue - health 500, attack 300

The battle system works by using a fairly unforgiving risk-reward system.
There are two possible actions; attack and defend.
Attack inflicts damage but doubles the opponent's attack,
Defend does no damage (obviously) but halves the opponent's attack.
The idea is to punish overly aggressive play from the player and the AI.
Hesitate is activated if the player types an invalid command, 
and inflicts double the current enemy attack on the player.
There is also a 10% chance the AI will hesitate and have double the current
player damage inflicted on it.
